# Rulet_Blackjack Game Project
In this repository, ı converted the very popular Roulette and Blackjack games played on the internet betting sites into code. It also includes things like creating an account and logging into an account. Typed account names, passwords and balance amounts are also kept in the database.
The game does not have an interface, it is played on the editor console.
